<ul>
<li>A new <i>VisItExportDatabaseWithOptions()</i> function was added to Libsim that lets you specify options to the writer.</li>

<li>Libsim's <i>VisIt_VariableData</i> was extended so you can optionally supply it with multiple data arrays, permitting zero-copying of data in situations where it wasn't possible before.</li>
<li>Many more Libsim enhancements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many enhancements and bug fixes were made to the PLOT3D, Nek5000, VTK, Pixie, Mili and Silo readers for reading data. Enhancements were also made to the Tecplot and XYZ readers for exporting data.</p>
<h4>3.  The <i>Set save options</i> window was overhauled.</h4>
<p>The options for setting standard save options and advanced multi-window save options have been re-organized into a much simpler interface and a number of bugs in the window have been corrected.</p>
