<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
bug-fixes that were made to this release.</p>

<h2>Bugs fixed in version 2.2.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>VisIt's simV2 simulation instrumentation library was fixed so operations that require synchronization with the viewer, such as <i>VisItUpdatePlots()</i>, do not lock up in parallel when a simulation's slave callback function does not broadcast integers.</li>
<li>The xmlinfo tool now generates the correct plugin info for operator plugins that create expressions from vectors or tensors.</li>
<li>The xmledit tool now correctly greys out the operator section for plot and database plugins.</li>
<li>File format readers that produce point meshes with degenerate connectivity are now better supported; Pseudocolor plots now get the correct range for these files.</li>
<li>A problem was fixed with using Pick after animating through time.</li>
<li>The ray-casted volume renderer now properly honors non-white light sources.</li>
<li>When doing a ray-casted volume rendering, changes to the <i>Smoothing</i> button now correctly take effect in the lighting model.</li>
<li>LibSim is now installed on Windows.</li>
<li>Queries over time will no longer cause the engine to exit when invalid start and end times are requested.</li>
<li>The DualMesh operator now correctly works with 2D meshes that are not at Z=0 as well.</li>
<li>3D axis labels now show adequate precision when autoscaled.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed with the Nek5000 reader with absolute paths in the .nek5000 file.</li>
<li>build_visit was modified to work properly when Silo support was specified without also specifying HDF5 support.</li>
<li>build_visit was modified to use vtkjpeg with HDF4 on all platforms so that it worked on machines without jpeg installed.</li>
<li>build_visit was modified to use http instead of https for anonymous svn downloads, so that it would work on all platforms.</li>
<li>build_visit was modified to use a lower level of optimization when building VTK with gcc 4.5.1 to avoid an internal compiler error in gcc.</li>
<li>The visit-install script now properly installs visitdiff.py.</li>
<li>An issue was fixed in which the detection of the Eureka machine at Argonne was too lax, causing special case code to apply to other machines.</li>
<li>VisIt no longer forces out-of-tree plugins to use the same compiler VisIt was compiled against, working around issues with compiler wrappers on some supercomputers.</li>
<li>A problem was fixed where using Box Operator didn't work correctly on a Point Mesh after Index Select Operator was applied.</li>
<li>The UltraWrapper will now manipulate curves correctly when multiple ultra files are opened and plotted.</li> 
<li>Pick through time after creating a time-history curve once, then changing the plotted variable now operators on the correct variable.</li>
<li>All simulation example programs now build.</li>
<li>The node_degree expression caused an exception when operating on 2D cell types.</li>
<li>A memory corruption error was fixed in the FLASH reader.</li>
<li>A bug preventing EvalCubicSpline and similar functions from being used in VisIt's CLI was resolved.</li>
<li>Exporting a plot to a Silo database now preseves existing axis labels.</li>
<li>The y-axis label created for 1D DataBinning results was improved.</li>
<li>'make package' now works correctly for out-of-source builds.</li>
<li>The process for creating compatible SIL restrictions between timesteps and similar databases was improved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enhancements in version 2.2.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are now host profiles for NICS at UTK, as well as an install option.</li>
<li>VisIt will now use the internal platform name <i>darwin-x86_64</i> on MacOS X 10.6 and later. This allows the older MacOS X 10.5 <i>darwin-i386</i> version to be installed side by side with the newer 64-bit version in directories that contain multiple VisIt installations for different platforms.</li>
<li>Event handling has been rewritten in VisIt's Java client so it no longer requires a second thread. Synchronization with a 2 thread design proved to be too error prone and evidently did not work on all Java virtual machines.</li>
<li>The visit-install script was ported from C Shell to Posix Shell so that it would run on a larger range of platforms.</li>
<li>xml2cmake was enhanced so it enables Fortran language compilation when the user adds Fortran files as custom sources in VisIt plug-ins.</li>
</ul>
