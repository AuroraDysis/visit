<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>

<h2>Bugs fixed in version 2.10.3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the LAMMPS database plugin that caused axis scaling to always be applied.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with command recording where it would report the name of the function for getting the pick attributes as "PickAttributes" instead of the correct name "GetPickAttributes".</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where VisIt could not draw a Mesh plot of a .vtu file with only points (no cells) defined.</li>
  <li>Fixed a few issues related to the Pseudocolor plot's use of ColorTable opacity: the viewer crashed when creating a transparent colortable with the command line interface; the Pseudocolor plot was affected by changes to a ColorTable it wasn't utilizing; changing the opacities of a ColorTable associated with a Pseudocolor plot would cause the Pseudocolor plot to go blank.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug using system python on Windows, error parsing added arguments.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the EnSight database plugin with EnSight Gold files where the geometry file name was specified by wildcards and a '001' numbered geometry file did not exist.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the PLOT3D database plugin that prevented multigrid, Fortran binary PLOT3D files from being read successfully.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the PLOT3D database plugin that prevented multigrid, Fortran binary, double-precision, iblanked PLOT3D files from being read successfully.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused invalid expression variables after deleting a plot and switching back to its active source.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with picking on the reflected part of a Subset plot with the Reflect operator applied.</li>
  <li>Changed how MFEM Meshes are constructed to avoid a coordinate system problem with the high-order Nedelec case.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the Volume plot attributes window involving widgets losing focus as data was typed.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem adjusting symbol sizes in curves for any symbol type other than point.</li>
  <li>Prevent leading slash character in expression names from causing empty submenus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements in version 2.10.3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Resample operator was enhanced to handle polygon cells.</li>
  <li>The Cosmos++ database plugin was enhanced to support reading particle data.</li>
  <li>Added optional input and output frames per second options to <i>visit_utils.encoding.encode</i>. These enable more precise frame rates for ffmpeg outputs.</li>
  <li>Several parameter names were changed to make the <i>visit_utils.qannote</i>, <i>visit_utils.qplot</i>, and <i>visit_flow</i> python modules have a consistent interface.</li>
  <li><i>visit_utils.qannote.MultiProgressBar</i> was changed to use percentages for the segment ranges and input position.</li>
  <li>Added a warning message to VisIt's CLI when a file named 'visit.py' is found in the current working directory at CLI startup. When this happens the 'visit.py' file is imported instead of VisIt's actual python client interface, which breaks the CLI. This happens rarely, but has confused users and developers so we wanted to detect and explain the situation.</li>
  <li>The Silo database plugin was enhanced to, in certain circumstances, load up the block decomposition of a mesh as variable. The resulting variable is then availabe for use in operators, such as Threshold, where it can be used as a poor man's subset selection.</li>
  <li>Improved memory scaling for the SPH Resample operator. Also, rewrote large portions of the SPH code to improve overall efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.10.3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Build_visit's python support was updated to use python distutils to determine the proper python library directory when using system python installs.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with build_visit where the Mili library wouldn't build properly without a fortran compiler in your path.</li>
</ul>
