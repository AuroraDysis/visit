<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A bug was fixed where VisIt would crash when saving images in screen capture mode.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed where scalable rendering (the parallel rendering mode) would leave out portions of the data set under a variety of conditions, including zooming in too far or clipping away part of the data set.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed where a slice that lay between two, flat domain boundaries could lead to a double contribution (one from each boundary). The images from VisIt were basically unaffected, but integrations (Weighted Variable Sums) and2D area queries were double counting.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed where index selecting a multi-block mesh when "Use Whole Collection" was set would index select the mesh on a per-block basis, instead ofacross the entire mesh. It now index selects across the entire mesh in that situation.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed where the GUI would crash on exit on some platforms after having opened the Volume plot attributes window.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed with the Windows installer so that it correctly set the chosen network configuration files.</li>
  <li>The help files have been made available once again for the windows platform.</li>
  <li>The 'change username' option in the password window on Windows no longer crashes.</li>
  <li>Silex no longer crashes on start up on Windows.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed with the reading of curves with the Ultra file format reader. Previously, for a multi-curve file, if curve N+1's first point was the same as curve N's last point, then curve N+1's first point was
      being incorrectly discarded.</li>
  <li>A bug was corrected with the Enzo file format reader, where the expressions for velocity and particle_velocity were defined incorrectly.</li>
  <li>The Nek file format reader can now read meta-data for files larger than 2GB.</li>
  <li>The DDCMD file format reader was enhanced to read ascii and binary format atom files.</li>
  <li>Host profiles for LLNL's hera system have been added.</li>
  <li>The host profiles for LLNL's juno system have been corrected to handle node names with 4 digits.</li>
  <li>The source code was modified so that VisIt would compile with the gcc 4.3.x compilers.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed with VisIt's configure script where the configuration switch --with-hdf5 would attempt to locate the hdf5 library even if it was not requested or even specifically disabled.</li>
  <li>The file depcomp was added to the binary distributions so that plugins could be built against the binary distributions.</li>
</ul>
