Here's what I (Hank Childs) do for the install process in addition to
what Eric does:

1) Install on janus and pomona.  My password is the same as my B-Division 
account.
Installed under /usr/local/apps/visit.  Irix6 only.
This install is for Jack Reaugh and Mike Howard.  It was requested by Jack in
 late September, 2004 and Mike in April.

The install line is:
visit-install -c open -l 1.4.4 irix6 /usr/local/apps/visit

Up until version 1.4.4, we were able to use the Riptide binary on Janus.
When riptide went away, we had to start using the hyper binary.  Hyper is
CC V7.4, Janus is V7.3.1.3m. Pomona is V7.2.1, but that works just fine.

So the hyper versions do not run on janus by default.
To make them work, you can copy over the following libraries
(paths given for location on hyper):

/usr/lib64/libCsup.so
/usr/lib64/libC.so.2
/usr/lib64/libc.so.1



2) Install on CASC cluster.

There are two partitions that you have to install on, tux01 and tux99.
Some machines mount the filesystem from tux01 (the redhat 7's I think), and some
from tux99.  Do not install both at the same time, because the home directories
are shared and the gunzip's, etc can interfere with each other.
The password is the same as LC machines.

The directory to install in is /usr/apps/visit.
The install line is:
visit-install -c open -g visit -gw 1.4 linux /usr/apps/visit

Note: tux01 cannot take linux_rhel3, because the compiler is too old.  tux99
can take linux_rhel3.

Note: logging is not useful on the CASC cluster, since the /usr/local/apps/visit
is a read only file system for all but tux01 and tux99 (so they can't update
the 'usagelog' file).

It is not entirely clear how heavy the usage is on these machines.  I believe
Bob Anderson and Andy Wissink make enough use to justify the install, but I 
do not know for sure.  Others, such as Gary Kerbel and Mike Owen, also use
the code there, but their usage is somewhat transitory (Mike because he
no longer has an account on those machines).



3) Install on A-Division machines.

On the open side, we install both Linux and Darwin.  We cannot test the Darwin
install.  The install is done from my open-side Linux box, wizard.
The group to use is "vis_dev", which is myself, Dan Laney, and Steve Langer.
Steve did an install once that was not group-writable, so there are frequently
errors when installing the data files -- this does not interfere with the
rest of the process.

On the closed side, we install Linux from my machine, saruman.  We do not
install Darwin yet, but it is anticipated that we will at some point
in the future.

On open:

visit-install -c open -g vis_dev -gw -l 1.4 linux /usr/gapps/visit
visit-install -c open -g vis_dev -gw -l 1.4 darwin /usr/gapps/visit

On closed:

visit-install -c closed -g vis_dev -gw -l 1.4 linux /usr/gapps/visit
visit-install -c closed -g vis_dev -gw -l 1.4 darwin /usr/gapps/visit


Note: Jay Salmonson's machine, panhead, is still at redhat9 and it is
not compatible with the rhel3 version.  I was able to make it work by
copying over libXrandr.so.2, libXcursor.so.1, and libstdc++.so.5.
I have an account on panhead.


4) Install for Brits.

The installs for the Brits is done through /usr/icf/jeshare/visit.
We install Tru64, Linux, and AIX.

This was requested by Steve Langer over a year ago, but I do not believe
that anyone is using this, even though we make regular installs.
Candidates to use it are John Edwards and Des Pilkington.

/usr/icf/jeshare/visit is accessible on most LC closed machines.  I do my
installs on white.

visit-install -c closed -l 1.4 linux /usr/icf/jeshare/visit
visit-install -c closed -l 1.4 aix /usr/icf/jeshare/visit
visit-install -c closed -l 1.4 osf1 /usr/icf/jeshare/visit



5) Notify Neil Hodge

Neil does the installs for the Engineering network, open and closed.
He accesses the binaries under the /usr/gapps/visit/1.4/visit-dist directory
on the LC machines.
