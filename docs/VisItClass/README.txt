                Visualization with VisIt class preparation
              ==============================================

More than 1 day before the class
=================================

1. Obtain the latest released version of VisIt for the Windows platform.
2. Go through all of the class exercises in VisItClassExercises.doc and make
   sure that they work with the version of VisIt that will be used for the
   class. Make appropriate changes when the class exercises do not work with
   the current version of VisIt. That could be caused by bugs or user
   interface changes.
3. Make necessary updates to VisualizationWithVisIt.ppt.

At least 1 day before the class
================================

4. Print 1 double-sided color copy of the slides in VisualizationWithVisIt.ppt.
5. Make 17 double-sided black and whitecopies of the slides using the
   black and white copier in room 1481. Just stick the whole stack into the
   feed on top of the copier and print 17 copies. The copier will take care
   of the rest. Get these going first since it takes over an hour to make
   all of the copies. Be sure that you make double-sided copies!
6. Print 17 double-sided color copies of VisItClassExercises.doc on the
   color printer in room 1481. They need to be color because they need to be
   easy to see and color helps a lot to in later chapters like Making it
   pretty. It takes about an hour and twenty minutes to print these handouts.
   I didn't time it all that carefully.
7. Print 18 copies of CourseFeedback.doc, which is the course feedback form.
8. Burn a few CD's with all of the class documents and the latest Windows
   version of VisIt. Having multiple CD's will make the installation go faster
   if you have to do it yourself.
9. Install VisIt on each class computer in classroom 2 in the LC-training
   center in B1889. Try and get the sysadmin Steve Kiar to do it.

The day before the class
=========================

10. If you plan to cover the chapter on remote vis then get the workshop
    OTP tokens from LC-hotline or Blaise Barney x2-2578. All but the first
    3 VisIt classes have skipped this step because there is no longer a
    computer at LC that is guaranteed to be available for training.

The day of the class
=====================

11. Bring donuts to the class and arrive around 8 since class starts at 8:30.
