Installation for the Q machine:

1) Copy the source distribution to Q.

Note -- there are two partitions to Q.  Right now we need to use
the first one (qfe1) because LLNL batch partitions are there.

sc1:>> cd ~brugger/visit1.4.1
sc1:>> scp visit050110.tar.gz meredith@qfe1.lanl.gov:

2) Go to Q.

Note -- despite the fact that my user id is the same as on the LC
machines, I still need to specify my id on the ssh line.  They
know about the problem but can't give me a reason, so just an FYI.

sunrise:>> ssh meredith@qfe1.lanl.gov:

3) "llogin" to get to the compute nodes

Note -- you can't do anyting on the "front end" nodes.  You have
to actually go to a compute node, and "llogin" the way to do it.
If the default queue is full, you need to specify a different
queue; list the queues with bqueue and choose one like lvizq or
lsmallq, and specify it with a "-q lvizq" option to llogin.

qfe1:>> llogin
Job <121214> submitted to default queue <ldevq>
<<Waiting for dispatch ....>>
<<Starting on q21>>
... snip snip ...

q21:~ [1] >

4) Unpack the distribution

Note -- don't try to build in scratch space.  It doesn't work
because of filesystem issues.  Just do it in your home directory.

q21:~ [1] > gunzip visit050110.tar.gz
q21:~ [2] > tar xvf visit050110.tar
q21:~ [3] > cd visit050110

5) Look at the config-site for Q to see the module commands.

Note -- to pick up even basic things like g++ and MPI you need
to use modules.  Execute these commands as listed at the top
of config-site/q.conf.  Also, if these need to change because
MPI or gcc was updated, there are more instructions in that
config-site file for how to update it, because things like
the LDFLAGS also will need to change.

q21:~/visit050110 [4] > cat config-site/q.conf
q21:~/visit050110 [5] > module add gcc_3.0.4
q21:~/visit050110 [6] > module add MPI_64bit_R5

6) Look at the config-site for Q to see the configure command.

Note -- since you can be on any compute node of Q, you must
specify the config-site file to use.  Again, this command
is specified in the q.conf file.

q21:~/visit050110 [7] > env CXXFLAGS="-O2" ./configure --with-config=config-site/q.conf --enable-parallel

7) Build it.

q21:~/visit050110 [8] > make

8) Make the binary distribution; skip the data.

q21:~/visit050110 [8] > ./clearcase_bin/visit-bin-dist -nd

9) Install it!

q21:~/visit050110 [8] > ./clearcase_bin/visit-install -g llnl 1.4.1 osf1 /usr/projects/llnl_b/visit

...and choose "No system configuration".  This is because no one
actually runs the VisIt GUI on Q; they only run an engine or
mdserver on Q, and our host profiles have not been tested for this
purpose (going from LANL to LLNL).
