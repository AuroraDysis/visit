To run this program, you will need to have "visit" in your path. You may also
need to add VisIt's lib directory to the Python path. One way to do that is to
add a line to the script where you add a line like this:

sys.path.append("/usr/gapps/visit/2.2.2/linux-x86_64/lib")

This change is geared towards making sure that you can import the visit module
into your Python interpreter.

Running the script:

    python visitdocs.py > cli.tex

Generating a PDF from the Latex file:

    pdf2latex cli.tex


Once you've done these steps, you can open cli.pdf and see the functions
described by the VisIt module.

Note that the visitdocs.py script imports the VisIt module and extracts its
doc strings for each function in the visit module. This means that undocumented
functions in the VisIt module will not have documentation. We'll need to 
update the visit module. This isn't 100% optimal either because the Python 
Interface Manual provides some extra material that this program does not
generate. Perhaps the right solution is to latex-ize the extra chapters for
that manual and generate the reference portion from the visit module, with
the real reference materials being in the visit module doc strings.
