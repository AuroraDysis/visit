The manual of VisIt's Python interface is written in LaTeX.
The manual is a combination of instructions of how to use the CLI and
function-by-function documentation.
The function-by-function documentation is extracted using a Python script.
This script imports VisIt and gets the online documentation for each method.
It then creates LaTeX for that documentation.

If you want to re-generate that documentation, you do something like:
MANUALDIR=/path/to/PythonManual
cd /path/to/visit/bin
cp ../lib/visit.so .
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD
cp $MANUALDIR/doc_extractor.py .
python < $MANUALDIR/doc_extractor.py > $MANUALDIR/VisItPythonManual.tex
cd $MANUALDIR
make

Of course, you should diff the old version of VisItPythonManual.tex with the
new one and make sure all functions and attributes got exported properly.

Two important notes:
(1) doc_extractor.py is set up such that it writes out the title page
before it can identify the version number of VisIt.  I tried to reorganize
the script so that it could parse out the version number first, but failed.
So, when updating for a new version of VisIt, you should manually change the
version is doc_extractor.py.
(2) VisItPythonManual.tex is generated by doc_extractor.py.  Do NOT modify
this file directly.  If you want to change the LaTeX contents, modify
doc_extractor.py.
