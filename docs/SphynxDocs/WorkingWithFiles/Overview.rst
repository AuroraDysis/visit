.. _Working With Databases Overview:

Overview
--------

In this chapter, we will discuss how to work with databases in VisIt. A 
database can be either a set of files on disk or a running simulation. You can 
manage both types of databases using the same VisIt windows. First we'll learn 
about the :ref:`File Selection Window` which allows databases to be selected 
and grouped. Next, we'll learn how to open databases for visualization using 
the :ref:`File Panel` before learning how to examine information about a 
database using the :ref:`File Information Window`. Finally, we'll learn how to 
reopen a file and close a database.
