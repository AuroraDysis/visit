Changing tube appearance
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Tube operator provides a few knobs that control the appearance of the 
generated tubes. 
First of all, the tube width can be set by typing a new width into the 
**Width** text field in the **Tube operator attributes window** 
(:numref:`Figure %s <tubewindow>` and :numref:`Figure %s <tube2>`). 
The number of polygons used to make up the circumference of the tube can be 
altered by typing a new number of sides into the **Fitness of tube**
text field. Finally, the ends of tubes can be capped instead of remaining open 
by turning on the **Cap Tubes** check box.
